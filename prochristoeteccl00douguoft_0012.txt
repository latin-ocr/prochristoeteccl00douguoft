(ι) When the motive of religion is to give to God, the
heart's most humble and genereus instincta are
attributed to him, and dominate the creed 3
when the motive is to gain from God, the con-
ception of him has lower attributes, and thus
the religion is poisoned at its source.

ceive just reward in the next life, although
those of us who are Pharisees or Sadducees may
not be nearer to the Christ then than we are

now.
