24 PRO CHRISTO ET ECCLESIA ,

ance and glory and dominion would be
heaven's free gift3 therefore they made
for the law a fence of unending explica—
tions and applications, increasing the
number and weight of their exactions‚
which one and all found their cause
and use in this command: “Come
out from among them and be ye
separate.’'

This party gained the name of Sepa—
ratists, i.e. Pharisees. Many, indeed,
of the legal observances had for their
chief aim the dissociation of the pious
from the Gentile and the impious. We
can have no difficulty in sympathising
with this, for is it not an advantage in
our own estimation? I could quote,
were the sentiment not too familiar to
repeat, many passages from recent
manuals of devotion, Romanist and
Anglican‚ warnings to those who would
lead the higher life, against such reading
and behaviour as would put them in
touch with companions of another mind.
