HISTORICAL SKETCH 23

The restrictions of both these Churches
against worship with Christians of other
persuasions is well known. Or again,
the writings of members of the more
advanced evangelical school, such as
Rev. Andrew Murray and Mr. Moody,
are full of passionate exhortation to
separation from “the world.'’ So that
we must all be perfectly conversant with
this aspect of the pious life.

We miss, however, much of the
lively understanding we should have
otherwise of the standpoint of the Phari-
sees by the fact that the words “law''
and “legal,'’ as also any avowed osten-
tation in religion, have become so oppro-
brious by verbal familiarity with the
Gospel condemnation that We need to
call the same things by other names in
order to recognise that degree of virtue
which they really contained. Study of
the law meant for the Pharisee increasing
obedience to the revealed scripture as
interpreted by the progressive tradition
