THE LESSONS OF THE CONTRAST 95

Keeping in mind our belief that the
divine author of the world⁷s tragedy will
teach his greatest lessons by the strongest
contrasts‚ and perceiving that conserva-
tism in religion showed itself most deadly
in Judaism as it met the Christ, we will
look for the perfection of the art of
conserving in the spirit with which Christ
met the Jews.

The Sadducean part of the Jewish
nation met Jesus generations before he
came, when the faith of the priestly class
in the unseen defence of Jehovah failed,
and they began to trust to their own
arm to get them the victory. Just there
history shows us that the priesthood
began to reject the new light which the
faith of the Pharisee was sucking in
from the progress of thought. They
did not refuse to advance in secular
things; they refused to improve their
religion. The resurrection, victorious
prayer, the spiritual environment of
human life—these had such small place
