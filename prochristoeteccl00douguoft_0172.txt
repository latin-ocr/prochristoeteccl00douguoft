146 PRO CHRISTO ET ECCLESIA

God ! '’ Yet, on the whole, to-day the
Church believes that the man who prays
and obeys is nearer God than he who
does not. It is as honest a mistake as
ever Pharisee made, but it comes of
spiritual pride, and out of it arises the
sentiment that the Christian who does not
attack evil-doers is recreant. But if the
wrong-doct· is wrapped in God's heart as
is a delirious child in the mother’s arms,
his unconsciousness of privilege does not
alter God's care for his birthright of
liberty, his dignity, his manhood. It is
said that an archangel dare not rail
against a devil, but we, alas, have few
such scruples with regard to God's own
image. The result is not good3 all
simplicity in the Christian's relation to
the world is destroyed ; we are involved
in complex passions3 the safety of our
children, the cause of good, cannot
possibly depend upon the compromise
with hatred, malice, and all uncharitable—
ness which such carnal warfare involves.
