THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEES 45

this form of false religion, but at its life-
principle, that God launched his thunders.

This life—principle must be that con-
ception of God's character that made
Pharisaism possible. Their God was a
God whose favour was conditional upon
obedience—obedience to what? If you
take a savage and persuade him that
God's favour to him depends on his
obedience, he will not be long in making
a code literal and ever-growing. That is
the history of much religion. It matters
less what the code is—that is an affair of
circumstance and mental development.
But in the heart of the prophets God‘s
word has always struggled against natural
self—love, against national pride, to make
clear that favour must be the cause, not
the result, of service. Jesus was the
only prophet in whom there was no
pride or self—love, in him alone this word
could come quite clearly—the father-
love, emphasised, as it were, towards dis—
obedience.
