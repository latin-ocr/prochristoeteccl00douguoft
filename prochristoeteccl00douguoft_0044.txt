individual life. The oral tradition, which
was the explanation of the laW, and its
application to everyday incident, made
individual obedience to it possible.
When we further consider the really
spiritual nature of the synagogue services,
which were established everywhere for
the teaching of the law, and that the
psalms of the-period express no sense of
a burdensome nature of this applied law,
but rather the liveliest delight in its
precepts‚ we shall realise what ardour of
religion must have inspired this great
legal movement. When we chant to-
day one or other of these psalms do we
understand that historically we are re-
joicing in the minutiae of tithings and
ablutions and sabbatical exacffions, the
keeping of which caused the devout Jew
to feel in harmony with God ?

“ The statutes of the Lord are right, and
rejoice the beart: the commandment of the Lord

is pure, and giveth light to the eyes.''
