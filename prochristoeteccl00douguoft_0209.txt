CHAPTER III

LOVE'S scE1¹TIC1SM

IT may be that the wings under which
the Christ of God would gather us bear
no more relation to our vexed creeds
concerning his teachings than does the
brooding note of the mother bird to
the causes which threaten her young.
Enough for her that there is need3
she shelters them in herself. It would
certainly seem from the Gospel story
that, not the knowledge which is self-
evident to all men, but that which is
self—evident to all who repent of their
dead selves, is sufficient. Jesus brought
new fidings, but he seems to have
taught that repentance would perfectly
attune the mind to his news.
