witnesses for its divine power to lift
heavenward long enough to feel any
answering thrill. The mistake has been
honest, but it has certainly been caused
by the lack of fellowship and of that
charity which St. Paul says is credulous
and hopeful of all endeavour. At its
root, near or far, probably lies the desire
to attain heaven rather than to give
lavishly to God and man. But whatever
its cause, its results are obvious. Let
us lay them before its advocates.
Granted that the greater part of all
works of artistic worth are ungodly‚
whose the fault? Art cannot be did-
actic; it can be wholesome and recrea-
tive; it can be true, holy, glorious. If
it is not this, the irreligious, whom you
consider its sole authors and patrons, are
not to blame. What could sinners
bring forth but sin? The power was
there for your using3 if you, the
good, have not used it, how can
you expect the product to be good?
