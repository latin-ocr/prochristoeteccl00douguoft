ARGUMENT

(2) Beginning with the revival under Em, the history
of the religious ardour of Judaism may be
traced.

(3) After the persecution under Antiochus, the sacer-
dotal and conservative party differentiated from
the more progressive interpreters of the law,
who gained the name of Separatists.

(4) We can have no difficulty in sympathising with
the ideal of Separatism, because it is advocated
in all schools of religious thought to-day.

(5) Our horror of the word “ legal’⁷ as applied to rc-
ligion‚ and our trained antipathy to any avowed
ostentation in piety‚ cause us to misunderstand
the Pharisees. With them the legal was the
holy‚ and ostentation was chiefly a party badge
used for the sake of influence.

(6) While nearly all the ground of Judaism was held
in common by the two sects—the Sadducees
being merely the more moderate and stagnant—
the Pharisees represented the culmination of
the religious enthusiasms generated by the post-
exilian revival. They were fighting nobly for
the purest religious system the world then
kneW.

(7) When Jesus denounced them as “ hypocrites '¹ and
“children of he11‚” he must have referred to a
principle of falsity so deep that it could underlie
good intention.

(8) The life-long contest between the pious pharisee
and Jesus is the most salient point in the drama
of the Christ, and God's fullest teaching to
man must therefore be found in the struggle.
