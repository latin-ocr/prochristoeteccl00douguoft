FAITH ΟΝ EARTH 73

had vices and crimes ; that it was these,
not their lack of spiritual insight or their
mistaken beliefs, that formed the barrier ;
but it is evident that, however mercenary
and vain they may have been, they could
not have exceeded publicans and harlots
in these faults. Clearly‚ then, it was not
these faults, not even the fact that these
were committed in the name of religion,
that made Jesus so sure that the Jews
would die in their sins. Had they been
in any way conscious of misdoing, re—
pentance must have been a possibility.
That which danmed them was the fact
that they were convinced that they were
in the right.

We believe that Jesus Christ is the
same in this to-day of ours as he was in
that yesterday‚ and certainly the ques—
tion of practical importance to us is,
how far the same conditions would
obtain, the same religious parties repeat
themselves, if he returned as a visible
teacher in the present Church.
