THE NECESSITY FOR THIS IDEAL 137

class of thoughtful and pious minds that
the authority of any particular ordination
recommends itself, it is hardly possible
to read our Lord’s contention with rab—
binism and not feel that it is especially
impious to make subscription to such
authority a test of obedience to him.
This is the weakness to which reli-
gious humanity is most apt. The natural
development of all religion3‚ especially
Judaism, illustrates this. Apart from
the inspiration of immediate spiritual
insight, we desire a sign so naturally, so
deeply——a something visible between
Church and world—that we are willing
to maim the Church‚ or wrap her in
sacerdotal cerements, if only we can
claim her grace in peace behind some
fortress wall. But when the sect most
eager for converts asked Jesus when
the Kingdom would come, he answered
that it would never come in such out-
ward semblance that men could say,
“Here it is‚’' and “Here it is not.''
