34 PRO CHRISTO ET ECCLESIA

task suggested by the Gospel drama is
to find wherein the Christ—life seemed to
the true pietist subversive of good.

It requires no deep research to per-
ceive wherein the religion of Jesus chiefly
differed from that of the pious Jew. His
God was the father of sinners ; his prac-
tice was friendship with sinners.

Now let us consider first his prac-
tice, for through that his conception of
God‘s perfection as consisting in bless-
ing equally the just and the unjust is
clearly seen.

Jesus feasted with sinners. Some, of
course, of his companions at these feasts
were sinners only in the legal sense, but
some were also vicious. They were all
undoubtedly sinners in our sense, not
doing what they believed they ought to
do, and doing that which they believed
they ought not to do. There is no
record—not one—that in social con—
verse Jesus interfered with their habits
of life by didactic gravity or reproach.
