100 PRO CHRISTO ET ECCLESIA

much more the {father heart of God for
love of man ? Jesus argues from God's
eagerness how terrible must be the need
for the utmost exercise of every human
power. The hosts of evil are up and
out; they are intense, wily, strong, and
have power to kill all that is heavenly
in human nature. VVhatever the hosts
of evil may be, it is obvious that Jesus
was convinced that with unceasing
activity they are bent on depriving the
human race of its birth-right. Therefore
all that a man has he must cast aside,
and fight in God's armour, untrammelled
by the garments of any hindering affec—

grown creed, fight and contend for the
progress of his own sou] and the world's.

whether one who feeds only on the past,
who is not inspired by a passionate faith
that the future will be better than the
past, can be a follower of Jesus. Certainly
if there be any meaning in the figures
