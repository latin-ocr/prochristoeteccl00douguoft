170 PRO CHRISTO ET ECCLESIA

assurance which says, “We have the
mind of God on such or such a point,
and all who differ from us differ from
him,'' we have the dynamite which
disrupts, and our religious history seems
to show that it has worked more like
hell's explosive than like the leaven of
God. The whole progress of Christian
thought has come down to us by means
of the clash of opposing parties, the two
swords which Jesus suffered in painful
prophecy rather than according to his
own glad ideal—-“ without observation.'’
And still to-day, whatever the high
moralising of some etherea] souls as to
the right attitude of the assured towards
an opponent, we all know that the atti-
tude in its practical working is that of
saying “ Raca,‘' or “ thou fool.'' Veiled
as it is in the progress we have made
toward reverence for man as man, this
attitude does and must dominate. The
merest child among us, taking notes, is
aware of this, and it is only sophistry
