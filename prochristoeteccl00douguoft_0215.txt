LOVE’S SCEPTICISM 189

echoed the call to this fellowship in the
fulness of intellectual and passionate
life? Would not many a repentant,
yet dubious soul rejoice if bidden to
nestle in the downy under-feathers of
divine protection amid the winds of
doubt? Would not the very sound of
the brooding-call‚ heard apart from the
lesser things which environ and pre-
judice it, induce repentance in weary
multitudes? If to echo this call be the
sole, or even chief, commission of the
labourers‚ the fields are perhaps more
ripe to harvest than we dream.
