of marriage, either of sex or friendship,
when the ideas “mine'' and “thine’‘
cease, a mood described in such lines
as—

“ Fancy light from fancy caught,
And thought leapt out to wed with thought.”

“All manner of fruits new and old, which Ι
have laid up for thee, O my bclovcd !''

The divine seal of human distinction,
self, is not at such times conscious ex-
cept in giving and receiving. Like this
is the humility of a father lost in glad—
ness over the returning runagate, or the
joy of motherhood. The new-made
mother cannot say in her heart to her
nestling what we habitually say to others,
“I am superior to you.'' She is not
even conscious of her humility‚ while
she looks with dread to the time when
she will no longer be the menial of the
tiny person. Humanity in all ages has
joined in crying‚ “ Blessed are these poor
in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom.”
