116 PRO CHRISTO ET ECCLESIA

sold for the least coin, and not one of
them without God. 'she tower in its
ruin crushes men no worse than their
neighbours; the tyrant slays with the
sacrifice the worshipper who is as pure
and devout as another ; the man who is
born blind suffers for the glory of God.
Out of this view of life grows his teach—
ing—monarchies shall fall and be created
in the lurid flames of bloodshed; see
that ye presume not to interpret and
say: “Here comes the Christ in judg-
ment,'’ or “ there in victory '' : it is not
for you to know God's times of punish-
ment and reward, for he makes the sun
of his love to shine on the evil and the
good. Be quite satisfied that the day of
judgment will never come according to
your expectation, but in a manner in
which, with your incapacity to judge,
you will think wrong. It will appear to
you as an evil-doer‚ and suddenly, in the
darkness of your prejudice it will come,
spoiling you of all your confidence.
