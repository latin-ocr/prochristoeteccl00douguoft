THE GREAT DRAMA 7

each one of us, of the party of Pharisee or
Sadducee “by faith,’‘ as surely as by
nature we have ardently scrupulous or
secular tendencies. In the Church there
are, besides, always a large number who
inwardly own the authority of faith, but
have postponed or despaired of obedience
to it. In its midst stands always the
Christ, representing just as much of the
vast creative heart as we can assimilate.
To the Christ are drawn the little band
of seekers for the heart of love.

But the drama of the Christ-life is
probably both more universal and more
particular than this. Within the soul
of every one who by near or remote
touch has been born again of his spirit,
Judaism—the interpretation of God by
our selfish, ἵζε. separatist‚ opinions—is
wrestling in undying struggle with the
divine revelation offered to our new-
born discipleship. This contest, probably
more than any other in all worshippers of
a personal God, is the contest of the old
man and the new, the flesh and the spirit.
