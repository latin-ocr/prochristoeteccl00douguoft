THE LEAVEN OF THE SADDUCEES 55

or mentioned it in his direct dealing?
He indicates where their fatal lack lay
when he reproves thern for not attend—¹
ing John's great revival meetings and
being converted‚ when he grieves be—
cause they will not render unto God the
things that are God's; but he expressly
commands that Caesar also have his due.
Any one who has learned the incom—
parable riches of his least word will be
slow to think that as he held the Roman
penny he thought only of the tax-
collector. The principle he then laid
down must apply to all departments
of a liberal life.

Again, he does not treat with them
at all concerning their difference with
the Pharisees. That he was keenly
aware of this sectarian difference is only
shown by his change of tone when
passing from one to the other. His
words to the Sadducees are very sparing,
and to the last his silence towards thern
is marked.
