74 PRO CHRISTO ET ECCLESIA

His own forecast does not give the
religious every encouragement to expect

good or the bad shall be most. He
gives no answer to his own question
when he asks whether in the future he
shall find faith on the earth.

jesus as were the Pharisees. It is dis-

made straight his highway, teaching the

Messianic hope in almost all civilised
