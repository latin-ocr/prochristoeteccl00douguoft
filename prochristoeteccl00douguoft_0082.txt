36 PRO CHRISTO ET ECCLESIA

It is worth while to consider the
chasni, the great gulfi that was fixed
between him and them, so wide that
he was hardly able to bridge it ,over
with the music of his call to life. The
voice which so easily penetrated the
tomb almost failed here.

What possible meaning could attach
to the constant assertion of Jesus that
every prayer is answered, if, as they
assumed, experience were limited to this
world? The first essential of the true
art of living which he preached is un-
doubtedly that this life should be con-
sidered as the merest fragment of an
immortal existence. His passion of
faith in the larger life which perfects
this was an organic part of his trust in
God’s fatherhood. He was emphatically
not content with the adjustment of things
here except as a part of a whole. Our
most violent pessimist is not more dis—
appointed with earth, apart from heaven,
than was Jesus, the incarnation of hope.
