¹24 PRO CHRISTO ET ECCLESIA

too. “Oh, if we could only be so
good!'' Jesus from the same class
drew affection because he identified
himself with all that was ordinary and
familiar, and the people do not seem to
have felt oppressed because he was far
above them in goodness‚ but simply to
have glorified God because he was what
he was. These tests are easy to apply.
Perhaps we get at the divine insight
into the true needs of the higher life
best by analysing the general belief that
a man is “the better for having sown
his wild oats,'' and “more lovable for
having a spice of the devil in him.” In
the depth of their thought people know
that these phrases represent truth; it is
no mere dare-devil mood that gives
them birth. At the same time even
careless and wholly secular men do not
desire vice in another if they can obtain
comradeship without it. They prefer
fineness of character, but do not want it
at the expense of those points of contact
