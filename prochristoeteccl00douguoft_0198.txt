call our spirituality into question, and
do we not feel bound, in witness to
this special truth of which we are the

causing some trumpet to be sounded, by
making some manner of prayer at the
street corners, some parade of our

are we not tempted to cherish the hope
that our reward will be the confounding
of our enemies ? Surely the trail of this
serpent in the garden is very clear!
Contempt is a strong word, but how—

the name of the slime. We all know
it in naming the sentiment which our
opponents as a class entertain towards
us. We all equally deplore it.
