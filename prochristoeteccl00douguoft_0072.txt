46 PRO CHRISTO ET ECCLESIA

In harmony with this is the con-
ception of prayer which depends on
the character thus attributed to God.
prayer, as Jesus taught it, was the practice
of the presence of the lover of sinners.
He never waited for any change of life
before dispensing boons from the F ather.
He did not select his audience when he
spoke to them of their Father's readiness
to hear. The chiefest and plainest part
of his elementary teaching was that the
first duty of man is to ask from God, not
for greed, but for need, not with anguish,
but with confidence. I say he said the
first duty of man is to ask, and the
response is not conditional but sure.
We twist his words into a thousand
meanings, but to the candid it is clear
that, be Jesus a true or a false teacher, he
made no condition for prayer but belief
in Godâ€™s willingness, and staked his
reputation on the certainty of a satis-
factory issue.
