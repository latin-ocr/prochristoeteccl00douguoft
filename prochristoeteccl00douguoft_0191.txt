THE GUIDING VOICE 165

absolute trust in Heaven's wisdom‚ with-
out the taint of that pharisaism which
commonly mars the Christian life.

There is before all men always the
problem of the immediate future calling
for decision, and when between paths
equally righteous, equally shrewd, the
choice must depend on the mere prob—
ability of unknown results, the baffled
mind is certainly permitted by the pro—
mises of Jesus to rest in his prescience,
warranted, however small the issue, in
humbly expecting to see the colt tied, or
the man bearing the waterpot; but he
who has truly studied the great lessons
of worldly experience and the drama of
Jesus’ life, will not boast himself in this
guidance, perceiving that the Spirit help-
ing infirmities is hampered by the great-
ness of the infirmities.
