THE GUIDING VOICE 157

man will be fitted out by Heaven with
a stock of correct opinions upon subjects
on which he is not called to decide;
and again, we do not mean that in
matters in which he is called to decide,
the guidance will take the place of
knowledge which he could and ought
to have gathered for himself. These
two exceptions cover more ground than
we are prone to suppose.

Here, for example, is an unlearned
Sunday—school teacher upon his knees
with the story of Abraham before him.
He has heard a disturbing whisper. He
prays for light. He reads some ex
parte statement which easily convinces
him that the higher criticism is folly.
He is comforted3 he has heard “the
voice'' in answer to his cry for light.
He earnestly denounces henceforth all
learned investigation into the ancient
records. Of course it is manifest to a
more educated mind that this man has
earned no right to any opinion whatever
