may be outwardly almost the sanie.
Lest this be not taken in at the first
saying, Jesus repeats the warning, “Take
heed therefore that the light that is in thee
be not darkness.'’ He also said that
they who spent their tirne endeavouring to
do-the works of the law, and to whom the
power of the Lord had not been revealed,
were given over to blindness, were “ blind
guides leading the blind.'' When he
said of their pharisaic minutiae, “This
ought ye to have done,‘' it became evident
that it was not the difference between
keeping one set of rules and another
which caused the distinction he was
pointing out between blindness and sight. .
The difference is caused by the attention
being directed God-ward or law-ward,
and consists in the presence or absence
of divine inspiration.
