(ι) The guilt of the murder of Jcsus belongs to men
who believed that morality and the true wor-
ship of God would be swept from the earth if
his teaching were accepted.

(z) Their opinion of Jesus was caused by—
(a) His fellowship with sinners.

(b) His neglect of religious rites.

(3) The pharisaic retort that his inspiration was
Satanic was most natural, as is proved by
examining what our feeling would be if he
came now and crossed our beliefs to the same
extent.

(4) Jesus taught that God offers the respect of love to
the good and wicked equally. The Pharisees
thought this subversive of morality. Their

conscience was the plant that had to be
rooted up.

(5) Those who are content to be bigoted for sear of
otherwise becoming indifferent to virtue and
truth‚ stand in the place of the Pharisee, and
at enmity with Jesus.

(1) The sins of the Sadducees were religione stagna-

tion and lack of spiritual insight. Their
virtue was worldly wisdom.
