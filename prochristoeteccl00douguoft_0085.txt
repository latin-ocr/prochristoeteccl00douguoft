between the bigotry of the extreme
pictists and the unbelief which pressed

The wisdom of this type of mind was
admired by Jesus. Again and again he
holds it up for imitation in such words
as “ Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
God.'' “Be ye wisc as serpents.''
“The Lord commended the unjust
steward; for the children of this world
are in their generation wiser than the
children of light.'' But against the reli—

against their spiritual indifferentism, by
all the force of his ministry he said,
“Man shall not live by bread alone.‘'
And he wrote ‘⁶ Death'' upon the
pol-tals of the temple where they made
it their whole business to sacrifice to

God.
