THE LESSONS OF THE CONTRAST 91

Nor does this conception contradict
his commands to leave all things—even
life itself -in ordei· to attain salvation.
In the battle of life a man must, if need
be, slay any natural affection, or cut
away his own membem, rather than fail,
holding all things subservient to the
interests of war ; but there is no hint in
this teaching that all rnen will fight the
better for being loveless or halt or blind,
that those provinces of activity which
may be misused should be abolished.
From the life of Jesus it is evident that
the case must be personal and extreme
when the temptation ought to be cut off
with the sin. Rather is the Christian's
common way that narrowest path that
lies along the height between the bottoni—
less slopes of disuse and abuse.
