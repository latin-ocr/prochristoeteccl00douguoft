THE GUIDING VOICE 161

It will be clear, therefore, that this
example covers many a case in which
the promise of Jesus is quite falsely
strained. Child-like saith in him is
content with such sort of knowledge
as he saw fit to give, the drawing out
of the spiritual significance from the
great parable of life, however and wher—
ever found; content with such sort of
ignorance as he permitted when of the
future he said: “It is not mine to
give,'' “No man knoweth save the
Father,'' and of the past when he
spiritualised popular beliefs rather than
emphasise a minor point by professing
to tell what the actual fact had been.

Next, as example of those who
expect God to guide when they have
neglected to obtain necessary secular
knowledge, let us take a man who,
having shunned those worldly experi-
ences which give worldly wisdo‘m‚ and
associated only with those who seek
religious paths‚ demands of God guid-
