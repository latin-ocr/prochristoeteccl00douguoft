186 PRO CHRISTO ET ECCLESM

the Church has ever been. The blind
Church which cannot accept the spiritual
religion of the Christ in its purity and
entirety, until it has read the continua—
tion of its own selfish and material
religions into it and out· of it once
more, is led by ways that it knows not ;
and we see in the more intimate record
of any age of the Church that the divine
life quickens successively now one phase
of religious thought and now another,
as if that which had become hackneyed
could not be its vehicle. Are we not,
therefore, bound to believe that in the
manifold diversity of Christian fellow-
ship, in the long stream of thought and
sentiment that flows through Christian
literature, there is room and food for all
possibilities, for all limitations of the
individual, who is surely safe with God
if he will but honestly pray. Just aS,
in natural things, isolate himself as he
will, he is still an organic part of the
race, moving with it in its development,
