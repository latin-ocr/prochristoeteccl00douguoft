TRUE AND FALSE RELIGION 9

example of the Indian mother who casts
her child before the idol car. Let us
suppose that there are two such.

The first feels that, represented by
the god, there is a goodness which she
has not satisfied, which craves recog-
nition from her by the gift of her best,
as she craves caress from the object of
her love. Vague, wordless, as the
feeling is, this is its nature. Heart full
of love, breast full of milk, she knows
how to give with devotion to her off-
spring; but there is one who has a
nearer and higher claim than even the
sucking child, so she gives her best,
beart-broken, but with blind comfort,
believing that even for herself and the
child it is better so. She cannot, per-
haps, say the word “ love‚'' yet is domi-
nated by the highest voice of her heart.
Her desire is to give rather than to get,
so that she is able to perceive what is
highest within herself, and attributes the
same characteristics to her God.
