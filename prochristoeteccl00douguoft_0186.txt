160 PRO CHRISTO ET ECCLESIA

replied “Yes'’ or “No,'' sending the
inquirer away with a complacent sense
of his own good information‚ and in the
temper of sels-satisfied polemic. A
child-like mind, poring lovingly over
the scenes of his great mastery and great
humility, must be at least dimly aware
that any spirit of what we call “cock-
sureness ” on either side of a vast issue
could never be inculcated by him.
Surely, too, we see that the “ babes'' to
whom great things are revealed are more
likely to be those who eagerly suck in
all obtainable knowledge, content to
wait and learn its worth from Time,
the sifter, than either those who are too
eager to accept novelty for truth, or
those who conceive themselves prudent
to neglect the new hopes of deeper
knowledge. To expect to be made
wise by the easy leap of a revelation
granted to necessary or wilful ignorance,
is not the babe-like temper of mind

imparted by Christ.
