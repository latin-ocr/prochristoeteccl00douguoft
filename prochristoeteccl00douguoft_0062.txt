36 PRO CHRISTO ET ECCLESIA

his behaviour when he fraternised with
publicans and sinners. These loved to
have him with them, while the righteous
looking on cried out in disgust that his
manner was convivial. His behaviour
gave to the cursory spectator the im—
pression of self-indulgence, and those
righteous persons who watched him
with critical zeal were confounded and
fell back upon a blacker interpretation.
When we consider all of friendliness
that it involves to eat a man's bread,
the behaviour of jesus concerning sinners
was very remarkable. If our neighbour
makes his money by corrupt practice,
and we accept his invitation to dinner,
it means, if we have any sense of honour
at all, that we will stand by him when
others condemn3 that we are prepared
to justify his dishonesty with at any rate
the plea that he is no worse than other
men. This last, at least, was what the
behaviour of the Christ said—that the
faults of the immoral were no worse
