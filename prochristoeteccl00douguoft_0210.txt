184 PRO CHRIsTo ET ECCLESIA

Is there, then, any gospel to which all
nien- --not by virtue of perfect sanity‚
for that is rare, but by virtue of true
repentancefflnmst subscribe? In such a
frame, are not most men willing to try
faith in the humility of God as set forth
in the touching message of Jesus’ life
and words? The Infinite taking upon
him the nieekness and humility of per-
sonal love, love that, when all else has
failed, is eager to accept this last wretched
gift of repentant team, and lead the
donor upon a fresh path, walking with
him hand in hand: this is the picture
Jesus drew of omnipotence.

After age—long discussion as to what
are the essentials of Christian doctrine,
prayer remains the essential. The
Fatherliness of God, as taught by Jesus,
implies constant prayer, not for “salva-
tion‚'' which has corne to mean personal
escape, but for that beart-felt creed, those
graces and favours Which are only valued
that they may be offered to God. Prayer
